This repo includes a template for making a MIDI vizualiser easily in godot 4x
It uses the code from the https://github.com/filemon-filemon/godot_sensor_midi_input_template
Use this repo if you want to create a godot project that needs midi input :O
But if you want a MIDI visualizer, this repo here is for you !!!
Should work with any kind of sensor plugged via MIDI, as long as it sends an integer/float to your computer.
Be sure to have your sensor plugged in before launching the program
If no sensor is detected at launch, the sprites will spawn following your mouse, instead of the midi signal
